                                <h4>2 Factor Authentication(2FA)</h4> 
							<section class="imge">	

								<div class="image"><img src="images/2FA.jpeg" alt="" /></div> 
							</section>
                                <P>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. With 2FA, you have to log in with your username and password and provide another form of authentication that only you know or have access to.
                                </P> 
                                <P>2FA enhances security in that it makes it more difficult for an attacker to take a password that has been reused across multiple websites and use it to try to gain access to an account that has been authenticated with 2FA.
                                </P>
                                <P>2FA is used by platforms such as websites like facebook, twitter, google, github to ensure security of their customers.</P>
                                <h4>Types of 2FA</h4>

                                    <dd>Here you are asked to provide your phone number when you enable this type of 2FA. When logging in, you will then be required to enter a short code that gets texted to your phone.</dd>

								</section>
                                    <dd>Here you use an application that generates codes locally based on a secret key e.g google authenticator or freeOTP. The underlying technology is called Time-Based One TIme Password(TOTP), and is part of the open Authentication(OATH)
                                        If a site offers this style of 2FA, it will show you a QR code containing the secret key. You can scan that QR code into your application. If you have multiple phones you can scan it multiple times; you can also save the image to a safe place or print it out if you need a backup. Once you’ve scanned such a QR code, your application will produce a new 6-digit code every 30 seconds. Similar to SMS 2FA, you’ll have to enter one of these codes in addition to your username and password in order to log in.

							<h4>IoT Communication Protocols</h4>
						<section class="imge">	
							<div class="image"><img src="images/pic13.png" alt=""  width="300"/></div>
						</section>
									
							<p>IoT protocols are broadly classified into two separate categories. These are:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>IoT data protocols(Presentation/Application layers)</li>
								<li>Network protocols for IoT(Datalink/Physical layers)</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>IoT Network Protocols</h4>
							<p>These are used to connect devices over a network. They are typically used over the internet.</p>
							<dl>
								<dt><b>Bluetooth</b></dt>
								<dd>Secure and perfect for short-range, low-power, low-cost and wireless transmission between electronic devices. It has a huge user base due to its integration into modern mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, as well as wearable technology such as wireless headphones.
									The new Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) or Bluetooth smart offers a similar range to Bluetooth but significantly reduced power consumption.

								</dd>
							<section class="imge">	
								<div class="image"><img src="images/pic10.png" alt="" width="300"/></div>
							</section>
							<dd> &nbsp;</dd>	
								<dt><b>Zigbee</b></dt>
								<dd>It has some significant advantages in complex systems offering low power operation, high security, robustness & high scalability as well as a position to take advantage of wireless control.
									Like Bluetooth, there is a vast user base of ZigBee.
									
									It is designed especially for industrial sites where low power is required and less for the consumers’ network. With a maximum 1024 number of nodes in the network, Zigbee can transfer data with a range of up to 200 meters. Zigbee is commonly used for home automation.</dd>
							<section class="imge">	
								<div class="image"><img src="images/pic11.png" alt="" width="300"/></div>
							</section>
							<dd> &nbsp;</dd>	
								<dt><b>WiFi</b></dt>    
								<dd>WiFi connectivity is one of the most popular IoT communication protocol, often an obvious choice for many developers, especially given the availability of WiFi within the home environment within LANs.

									There is a wide existing infrastructure as well as offering fast data transfer and the ability to handle high quantities of data. The most common WiFi standard used in homes and many businesses is 802.11n, which offers range of hundreds of megabit per second, which is fine for file transfers but may be too power-consuming for many IoT applications.</dd>
								<section class="imge">	
									<div class="image"><img src="images/pic12.png" alt="" width="300"/></div>
								</section>
								<dd> &nbsp;</dd>		
								<dt><B>LoRaWAN</B></dt>
								<dd>It is a long-range, low power protocol that provides signal detection below the noise level.
								</dd>


							</dl>

							<h4>IoT Data Protocols</h4>
							<p>They are used to connect low power IoT devices. Connectivity is through a wired or cellular network.</p>
							<dl>
								<dt><b>Constrained Application protocol(CoAP)</b></dt>
								<dd>CoAP is an internet utility protocol for constrained gadgets. It is designed to enable simple, constrained devices to join IoT through constrained networks having low bandwidth availability.
									This protocol is primarily used for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and is particularly designed for IoT systems that are based on HTTP protocols.

								<dd>It is a lightweight protocol for sending simple data flows from sensors to applications and middleware.</dd>

							<dd> &nbsp;</dd>
								<dt><b>Advanced Message Queueing Protocol(AMQP)</b></dt>    
								<dd>A software layer protocol for message-oriented middleware environments that provides routing and queuing. Is used for reliable point to point connection and supports secure exchange of data between connected devices and the cloud.

							<h4>OSI Model</h4>
							<p>The open systems interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization(ISO) which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. It provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.

							<h4>GSM VS GPRS. What is the difference?</h4>
							<P>GSM is a cellular standard for mobile phone communications to cater to voice services and data delivery using digital modulation where SMS has a profound effect on society. It is the standard-bearer of the 2G technologies. GSM is a circuit-switched network. In GSM billing is based on the duration of the connection. It does not allow direct connection to the internet. SMS (Short Messaging Service) is one of the popular features. It is used in almost all countries and provides its services to a large set of users.
							</P>
							<section class="imge">	
								<div class="image"><img src="images/GSM.png" alt="" width="300"/></div>
							</section>
							<P>GPRS is an up-gradation of GSM features over the basic features to obtain much higher data speeds and simple wireless access to packet data networks than standard GSM. It is the standard-bearer of the 2.5G technologies. GPRS is a packet-switched network. In GPRS, billing is based on the amount of data transferred. It allows direct connection to the internet. MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) is one of the popular features. It can not be offered to all countries as it is confined to developed areas with a proper network connection.

							<h4>IoT & cloud</h4>
							<p>The Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects—a.k.a. "things"—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.</p>
							<p>The cloud is simply the Internet—more specifically, it's all of the things you can access remotely over the Internet. When something is in the cloud, it means it's stored on Internet servers instead of your computer's hard drive.</p>
